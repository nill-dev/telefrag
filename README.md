# telefrag
Telefrag is a cross-platform library, service, and suite of utilities that allow you to rapidly develop Telegram integrations (bots, payments, authentication) in either .NET or JavaScript with a toolkit full of ready-made reusable components.  Telefrag abstracts away all of Telegram's API details, persistent state and storage, webhooks, certificates, web server configuration, authentication/authorization, and more.
