# Telefrag

Telefrag is a .NET Core library for interacting with Telegram using its various APIs and rapid development of highly composable components.  The primary goal of Telefrag was to decouple Telegram's nuances from C# developers and create a C#-friendly way of tying existing apps into Telegram.  The secondary goal was to make it easy for normal users to run their own custom bots with pluggable personalities or "layers" which can be offered as part of an ecosystem.
